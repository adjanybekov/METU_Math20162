To show that polynomial is prime. Show that it is monic and irreducible.
To show that it is irreducible. Show that if f = gh then deg(g)=0 or deg(h)=0. 
In this case it was achieved by showing the there is no. factors of degree (1 and 3) and (2,2) to satisfy this, which is the negation. To show this, you must show that if they existed they would lead to a contradiction.
