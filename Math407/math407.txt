Math 407 game theory:


Even if it means to learn major topics of the book:
It will be this:


What did we learn so far?

We learned subtraction games, nim games, and compoosite games.
we also learned zero sum games. whicha re basically matrix games:
Matrix games consisted of:
2*2 games, 2*n, m*2, n*m games.
n*m games which are nonsingular were solved using nonsingular strategy.

 Now we started the game colonel blotto:
  And there is a way to review these: night before going to the exam?
  No therefore I start preparing noe


  HW3:
  First I proved that, latin square games have uniform distribution of praobabilities, and that V = mean of values of any row or column

  Now I will prove:
  How Diagonal matrix gives a V, p and q.
  V = (sum of 1/d_i)^-1.
  from diagonal formula: [sum i from 1 to m (aij*pi)= V] where pi is in P;
  Since matrix is diagonal: all aij except i==j are 0 and therefore V= aij*pi
so pi = V/aij
elements of Q are found in the similar manner qi = V/aij.
This saves a lot of time and effort in solving these problems.

  Q = {q1 ... qn};
  P = {p1 ... pn};
