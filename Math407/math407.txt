Math 407 game theory:


Even if it means to learn major topics of the book:
It will be this:


What did we learn so far?

We learned subtraction games, nim games, and compoosite games.
we also learned zero sum games. whicha re basically matrix games:
Matrix games consisted of:
2*2 games, 2*n, m*2, n*m games.
n*m games which are nonsingular were solved using nonsingular strategy.

 Now we started the game colonel blotto:
  And there is a way to review these: night before going to the exam?
  No therefore I start preparing noe


  HW3:
  First I proved that, latin square games have uniform distribution of praobabilities, and that V = mean of values of any row or column

  Now I will prove:
  How Diagonal matrix gives a V, p and q.
  V = (sum of 1/d_i)^-1.
  from diagonal formula: [sum i from 1 to m (aij*pi)= V] where pi is in P;
  Since matrix is diagonal: all aij except i==j are 0 and therefore V= aij*pi
so pi = V/aij
elements of Q are found in the similar manner qi = V/aij.
This saves a lot of time and effort in solving these problems.

  Q = {q1 ... qn};
  P = {p1 ... pn};

I need to do sth about 407 today, tommorow because after tommorow I have MT1.
What should I do?
prep for exam and review last lecture concepts.
How? Latter is strfwrd. Solve todays problem and understand.
For others now, is to sole what we already solved.
Or also try hackerrank 1,2 problems.
What is not clear yet? Where do I feel weak now?
in Fictious game n*m matrix and hw, solve hw problem.
nonsingular matrix n*n.

Today I have mt1 on 407.
What is the first step??
Which steps are needed to increase the ability to solve todays questions on the exam?
Review notes, and solve one qn of each type.
Review parts that I am not sure about and then continue with, the rest.
