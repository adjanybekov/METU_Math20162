So far 1st mt is on 6th april before, 116 exam.


To this moment we have learned this:
Directional fields,
Mathematical modelling,
And used to solve problems of the sort: Solve the equation: or Find the solutions of the equation:
Which was equivalent to find f(x) = equation: Not in terms of derivatives, or using derivatives.

Chapter 1:
1.1 Some Basic Mathematical Models; Direction Fields

1.2 Solutions of Some Differential Equations

1.3 Classification of Differential Equations

Chapter2:First Order Differential Equations
2.2,
2.1,2.6,2.8,

Chapter 7:Systems of First Order Linear Equations
7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.5, 7.6(here), 7.7, 7.9

Chapter 4: Higher order differential equations:(probably ones we cannot turn into 1st order)

Chapter 5. Series Solutions of Second Order Linear Equations

Chapter 6. The Laplace Transform

Chapter 10. Partial Differential Equations and Fourier Series

Finish!(sexy place) That is it. Dif is done.

Currently we are learning:
Systems of first order linear equations,
