Now I am given a problem which asks: me to
prove that Z is a group wrt a * operation:
I remember this, but it is not concrete.
G is a group if 4 conditions hold:
1 G is closed under *
2 * is associative 
3 G has identity element
4 G contains inverses for all a in G

part B; asks to show that alfa is an isomorphism.
Lets define isomorphism.
let theta: G-> G'
function theta is called isomorphic if:
1 theta has 1-1 from G to G'
2 theta(x*y) = theta(x) ^ theta(y)

isomorhism from G to G is called automorphism.

We ve got some suggested problems, let's try them before coming to the lecture.

Now I feel that I am very back of the concepts learned in the class.
So let me just catch it up.
1. Start with solvving suggested problems.
2. Read the theorems.
3. solve past years mt1s.
Along the way learn new stuff.

Ok there is no s.p for this section, therefore I will choose them myself.
start is 2.5 congruence of integers. end is 2.6 conruence classes.

Ok now I think that I will start with solving exaples which have solution. TO learn.


I have 5 mt 1's.
I need to solve MT1s. Should I solve all of them?
When?
